//: ## Q1: Optionals
class Words {
    var wordA : String!
    var wordB : String!
    
    init (wordA: String?, wordB: String?) {
        self.wordA = wordA
        self.wordB = wordB
    }

//: ### Are the values passed in to the **init** function and those set to the instance
//: ### variables the same type? If not, why?


//: They are not considered the same time because it has an optional.
//: an optional illustrates that the String or whatever type can either be a String
//: or a nil.


//: ## Q2: Variable Types and Function Types
    class func arePalindromes(_ words: [String]) -> Bool {
        let reversedWords = words.map() {($0.characters.reversed())}
        let numElements = words.count
        
        for i in 0 ..< numElements {
            if words[i] != String(reversedWords[i]) {
                return false
            }
            
        }
        return true
    }
//: ### Why does the compiler dislike the **for loop**? Fix it.
//: ### What else is wrong with this function? You may have to refer to (but **not**
//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.


//: $0 is a string array so you cant cast it as a string
//: but since when you recurse through the reversedWords, you need to let the compire know what type it is, we can just cast it as a string
//: forgot to return true if nothing happens and also the fact that this arePalindromes are called not by a instance but as a class function of the class Words.

    func isAnagram() -> Bool? {
        var countLetters = [Character : Int]() //Line X
        let lenA = self.wordA.characters.count
        let lenB = self.wordB.characters.count
        
        if lenA != lenB {
            return false

        var arrA = Array(self.wordA.characters)
        var arrB = Array(self.wordB.characters)
        for i in 0...lenA-1 {
            let letter = arrA[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] { //Line Y
                countLetters[letter] = val + 1
            } else {
                countLetters[letter] = 1
            }
        }
        
        for i in 0...lenB-1 {
            let letter = arrB[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] {
                countLetters[letter] = val - 1
            } else {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        for (_, count) in countLetters {
            if count != 0 {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        return nil
    }
//: ### What is the problem with declaring **countLetters** as we do in **Line X**,
//: ### and then using it in **Line Y**? Fix it (by only changing **Line X**).
//: ### What else is wrong with this function? You may have to refer to (but **not**
//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.

//: the code below illustrates that they made a word object creating an instance of Words which means that its under the class Words not a class by itself so must erase Words.
//: let -> var because let will not be able to changed while var will and we are increasing countLetters.
//: Bool should be an optional because we returned nil at the end
